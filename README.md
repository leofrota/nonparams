Introduction
-----------------------
This is a set of R codes for nonparametric statistics and econometrics written for Applied Nonparametric Econometrics course. The content includes power tests for nonparametric distribution test methods, comparasions of nonparametric distribution tests under different settings, and application of local density kernels, etc.

The repo is intended for researchers and users of nonparametric methods to grasp the most frequently used methods in R and better understand the functional difference between different techniques.

The data was fetched from [Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) St. Louis Fed](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/). The source code is currently under rearrangement for beginner users of R.
